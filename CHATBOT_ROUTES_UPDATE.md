3. **One-Click Buttons** - "Go there →" buttons in messages
4. **Smart Confirmation** - Understands "yes", "sure", "take me there"
5. **Context Aware** - Knows which page user is on

## 🧪 Test Your Use Case

Try this exact conversation:

```
You: "I have a good video but it's in Hindi. My audience is English. What should I do?"

Bot: "Yes! We have video translation in Voiceovers that can help you 
translate your Hindi video to English. Would you like me to take you 
there? [Go there →]"

You: "yes" (or click the button)

Bot: "✅ Taking you to /voiceovers..."
[Navigates to Voiceovers page]
```

## 📋 What Changed

### Before
- Used generic routes like `/studio`

- Less specific feature mapping

### After
- Uses **exact routes** from your navigation menu
- Maps features correctly:
  - Video translation → `/voiceovers`
  - Image analysis → `/ai-vision`
  - Publishing → `/dashboard`
  - Scheduling → `/scheduler`
- Only suggests routes that actually exist
