You are an expert social media strategist. Generate 8 creative and engaging tweet prompt suggestions for the category: "${category}".

Categories and their focus:
- general: Broad appeal, trending topics, universal experiences
- business: Entrepreneurship, productivity, business insights, leadership
- tech: Technology trends, development tips, AI, innovation
- personal: Personal growth, life lessons, experiences, motivation
- entertainment: Pop culture, humor, viral content, memes
- education: Learning tips, knowledge sharing, tutorials, insights

For each suggestion, provide:
1. A clear, actionable prompt idea
2. The type of engagement it would generate
3. Why it would be effective

Format as JSON array with objects containing:
- "prompt": The actual prompt text users can use
- "engagement": Type of engagement expected (replies, shares, likes)
- "reason": Brief explanation of why it works
- "example": A sample tweet that could be generated from this prompt

Make the prompts:
- Specific enough to generate quality content
- Broad enough to allow creativity
- Trending and relevant to current social media
- Designed to maximize engagement
- Suitable for the target category

Return ONLY the JSON array, no other text.
